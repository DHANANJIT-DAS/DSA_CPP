-> Dijkstras algorithim is applicable for directed as well as undirected graph.

-> Dijkstras algorithim is not applicable for negative weighted graph.

-> Dijkstras algorithim is applicable in negative weighted directed graph is there is not such cycle where the total cost
   of the cycle is negative.(but it may take time as Dijkstras with queue).
